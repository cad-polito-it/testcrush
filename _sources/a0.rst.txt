a0 module
=========

This module implements the `A0 compaction algorithm <https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2016.2643663>`_ . The only difference 
with respect to the original A0 algorithm is that in order to validate a removal of an instruction from the STL, the 
evaluation happens on whether the new test application time is less or equal than the old test application time **AND**
whether the new test coverage is **greater or equal** than the old test application time. However, with the provided
utilities provided with the toolkit this can be extended or modified to the user's needs. All it takes is a few LoC
in the evaluation method of each iteration within the A0 class.
